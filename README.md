Hearth is a social reading tracker designed for presence, not just metrics. Unlike other apps that focus on how fast you read, Hearth is built to make reading feel communal, cozy, and calm. It’s like a digital campfire for you and your friends to sit around while you dive into your favorite books.

✨ Features I want to make
The Campfire (Live Sessions): Start a reading timer and appear at a virtual campfire. If your friends are reading at the same time, their avatars join you around the fire.

Soundscapes: Listen to high-quality ambient sounds like a crackling fire, soft rain, or a busy coffee shop while you read.

The Quote Wall: Share the lines that move you. Snap a photo or type a quote to share with your friends.

Spoiler-Free Feed: Photos of book pages are blurred by default. Your friends only see the content if they choose to "reveal" it.

Reading Bingo: Complete seasonal challenges (like "Read a book with a blue cover") to earn custom flame colors and rewards.

Goodreads Import: Easily bring your entire reading history over so you don't have to start from scratch.

Whisper Chat: Send quick text messages or "Quiet Nudges" (emojis) to friends at the campfire without breaking your focus.
